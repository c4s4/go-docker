# go-docker

This project builds a Docker image from scratch, so that the size of the image almost equals the size of the binary. A build file is provided with following targets :

- clean: to clean generated files
- build: to build the go binary for docker
- docker: to build docker image
- run: to run docker image
- client: to call docker image and print result
- size: to print size of binary and docker image

*Enjoy!*
